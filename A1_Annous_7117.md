There is no function that satisfies R2.

There are 4-5 test cases for every requirement R1 - R7. Many of these are common cases such as testing correctness with valid arguments, and testing error handing when incorrect arguments are given to functions. Specific test cases include database errors, calculating late fees, visual display correctness, borrowing / returning books process correctness, searching for books process correctness and displaying correct patron information.
